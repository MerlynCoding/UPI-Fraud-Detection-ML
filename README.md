# UPI-Fraud-Detection-ML

here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started with building your UPI fraud detection model using machine learning:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Load and Inspect Data**:
     - Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
     - Inspect the first few rows to understand its structure and identify any issues like missing or inconsistent data.
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
     print(df.head())
     ```
     
   - **Handle Missing Data**:
     - Check for any missing values and decide how to handle them: you can either drop rows, replace them with the mean/median, or use imputation techniques.
     ```python
     df.isnull().sum()
     df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Or use appropriate methods to fill missing values
     ```

   - **Feature Extraction**:
     - Convert the **Date of Transaction** into a datetime object to perform time-based analysis.
     ```python
     df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
     ```
     - Extract useful time-related features like:
       - Hour of the day
       - Day of the week
       - Month
     ```python
     df['hour'] = df['Date'].dt.hour
     df['day_of_week'] = df['Date'].dt.dayofweek
     df['month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
     ```

   - **Categorical Encoding**:
     - Convert categorical variables like **Category** into numerical form using encoding techniques (e.g., Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding).
     ```python
     df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Category'])
     ```

   - **Feature Engineering**:
     - Create new features such as:
       - **Transaction frequency**: How often a user transacts within a time period.
       - **Transaction size**: Create a feature like "transaction size" (difference between withdrawal and deposit amounts).
     ```python
     df['transaction_size'] = df['Deposit'] - df['Withdrawal']
     ```

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Visualize Distribution**:
     - Check the distribution of key features like the amount of withdrawal and deposit. This helps you identify potential outliers or patterns.
     ```python
     df[['Withdrawal', 'Deposit']].hist()
     ```
     
   - **Correlation Analysis**:
     - Check the correlation between different features to identify strong relationships that could inform the model.
     ```python
     df.corr()
     ```

   - **Visualize Fraudulent Transactions**:
     - If you have labels for fraudulent transactions, visualize their distribution across various features (like transaction amount, time of day, etc.).

### 3. **Data Splitting**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets. Since fraud detection usually has an imbalanced dataset, make sure to stratify your split (if fraud labels are available).
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X = df.drop(['Fraud'], axis=1)  # Drop the target column 'Fraud'
   y = df['Fraud']
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y)
   ```

### 4. **Model Selection**
   - **Train a Model**:
     - Start with a basic classifier like **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, or **XGBoost**. These are often good starting points for classification problems.
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
     model = RandomForestClassifier()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```

   - **Evaluate Model**:
     - After training, evaluate the model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (area under the curve), especially because fraud detection has imbalanced classes.
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score
     y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
     print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
     print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
     print("ROC AUC Score:", roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred))
     ```

   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
     - Use techniques like **Grid Search** or **Random Search** to tune hyperparameters and improve your model’s performance.
     ```python
     from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
     param_grid = {'n_estimators': [100, 200], 'max_depth': [10, 20]}
     grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid, cv=3)
     grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
     print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
     ```

### 5. **Dealing with Imbalanced Data**
   - **Resampling Techniques**:
     - Since fraud is likely a minority class, you can either oversample the minority class (fraudulent transactions) or undersample the majority class.
     - Use techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic data points for the minority class.
     ```python
     from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
     smote = SMOTE()
     X_train_res, y_train_res = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
     ```

   - **Class Weights**:
     - Some classifiers, like Random Forest or Logistic Regression, allow you to adjust class weights to penalize misclassification of the minority class.
     ```python
     model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced')
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Assess how well the model performs with the test data:
     - Check for **False Positives** (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) and **False Negatives** (fraudulent transactions not flagged).
     - Analyze the **Confusion Matrix** to better understand model performance.

### 7. **Model Deployment (Optional)**
   - Once you’re satisfied with the model, you can deploy it to predict fraud in real-time transactions.
   - You might want to create an API or integrate it into a larger system (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI for the backend).

### 8. **Monitor and Improve**
   - Continuously monitor the model’s performance after deployment. Fraud patterns can evolve, so periodic retraining with new data will keep your model accurate.
